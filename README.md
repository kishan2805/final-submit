# Object-Detection 

Our project focuses on developing an advanced object detection model to enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles.
Leveraging YOLOv5, the model identifies and classifies objects in real-time, ensuring the vehicle can make informed decisions in dynamic environments.


High Accuracy: Achieved 92% detection accuracy, critical for detecting pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and other road elements.
Real-Time Performance: Processes live camera feeds with minimal latency, making it suitable for real-world autonomous driving scenarios.
Adaptability: Designed to handle various environmental conditions, such as lighting changes, weather variations, and crowded urban settings.
Safety-First Approach: Enables prompt detection and classification of potential obstacles to prevent collisions and enhance driving decisions.


Getting Started
To run this project smoothly, we recommend using Google Colab. Follow the instructions below to set up and execute the code.

Quick Access
Click the badge below to open the project directly in Colab:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kishan2805/final-submit/blob/main/final-submission%20Qual-230331/code.ipynb)

Setup Instructions
Open in Colab: Click on the Colab badge above to launch the notebook.
Uninstallation and Reinstallation of Pillow:
There is a cell in the notebook that uninstalls the current version of Pillow and reinstalls a compatible version.
Important: After running this cell, restart the runtime for the changes to take effect.
Once the runtime is restarted:
Comment out the Pillow uninstallation cell to avoid re-executing it.
Resume running the remaining cells as usual.
